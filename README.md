Welcome to GBX.NET 2! Unfortunately, at the moment, there are still some compilation errors, due to some ChunkL wildness happening there. I will attempt to fix all throughout 1 January.

Visual Studio is probably the best IDE to use to see what's going on. Check out the `Dependencies -> Analyzers` section to see the source generators in action.
