GBX.NET is a GameBox (.Gbx) file parser library written in C# for .NET software framework. This file type can be seen in many of the Nadeo games like TrackMania, ShootMania or Virtual Skipper.

- GBX.NET can recognize **entire GBX files**, however **can't read all of the possible files**. GBX file is basically a serialized class from the GameBox engine, and all of these classes must be known to read. This is where you can help contributing to the project, by [exploring new chunks](https://github.com/BigBang1112/gbx-net/wiki/How-to-discover-nodes-and-chunks) (available very soon).
- GBX.NET can write GBX files which can be read by the parser, however this may not apply to all readable GBXs.
- All versions of GBX are supported: ranging from TM1.0 to TMÂ®.
- Reading PAK file isn't currently supported.

| Extension | Node | Can read | Can write
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| Map.Gbx | [CGameCtnChallenge](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnChallenge.cs) | Yes | Yes
| Replay.Gbx | [CGameCtnReplayRecord](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnReplayRecord.cs) | Yes | No
| Ghost.Gbx | [CGameCtnGhost](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnGhost.cs) | Yes | Yes
| Clip.Gbx | [CGameCtnMediaClip](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnMediaClip.cs) | Yes | Yes
| EDClassic.Gbx | [CGameCtnBlockInfoClassic](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnBlockInfoClassic.cs) | Yes | No
| Campaign.Gbx | [CGameCtnCampaign](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnCampaign.cs) | Yes | Yes
| Block.Gbx | [CGameItemModel](GBX.NET/Engines/GameData/CGameItemModel.cs) | Yes | No
| Macroblock.Gbx | [CGameCtnMacroBlockInfo](GBX.NET/Engines/Game/CGameCtnMacroBlockInfo.cs) | Yes | No
| Item.Gbx | [CGameItemModel](GBX.NET/Engines/GameData/CGameItemModel.cs) | Yes | No

## Compatibility

GBX.NET is compatible with **.NET Standard 2.0** since version 0.2.0. Earlier versions are built on .NET Standard 2.1.

Since version 0.5.2, the library is also compatible with **.NET Framework 4.5**.

The library is also set to **x86 assembly** due to LZO compression problems in x64. It is unsure whenever this will be resolved.

## Dependencies

## Usage

To parse a GBX with a known type:

```cs
var gbx = GameBox.Parse<CGameCtnChallenge>("MyMap.Map.Gbx");
// Node data is available in gbx.MainNode
```

To parse a GBX with an unknown type:

```cs
var gbx = GameBox.Parse("MyMap.Map.Gbx");

if (gbx is GameBox<CGameCtnChallenge> gbxMap)
{
    // Node data is available in gbxMap.MainNode
}
else if (gbx is GameBox<CGameCtnReplayRecord> gbxReplay)
{
    // Node data is available in gbxReplay.MainNode
}
```
